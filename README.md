##  Student Management System (Python + MySQL)

This is a simple **console-based Student Management System** built using **Python** and **MySQL**. It allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student records through a terminal-based menu.

###  Features

-  Connects to a MySQL database
-  Creates a `stud_info` table if it doesn't exist
-  Insert new student records
-  Display all student records
-  Update a student's city using their ID
-  Delete a student record by ID
-  Easy-to-use terminal interface

###  Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- MySQL
- `mysql-connector-python` for database connectivity

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-management-system.git
   cd student-management-system
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install mysql-connector-python
   ```

3. **Setup your MySQL database:**
   - Create a database named `python_1234`
   - Make sure your MySQL server is running
   - Update your MySQL credentials in the script if needed

4. **Run the program:**
